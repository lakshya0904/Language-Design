# Language-Design
This repository contains Language design and type expression computation project as a part of my course Principles of Programming Languages (CS F301) at BITS Pilani.

### Details about language specifications:
- The language is specifically designed to compute expressions involving arithmetic and logical operators. The operands can be of different types such as integer, real, boolean and arrays.
- The language implements two types of arrays- rectangular and jagged. The rows of rectangular arrays have same number of columns, and that of jagged arrays can have varying number of columns. A jagged array can be two or three dimensional while the rectangular arrays can be of any dimensions. The rectangular arrays can be static or dynamic in nature depending upon the range values available at compile time or run time respectively, but the jagged arrays are always static.
- The language has only two types of statements â€“ declaration and assignment statements.
